NAME
    ThreatNet::IRC - ThreatNet IRC-specific classes

  DESCRIPTION
    The ThreatNet concept is not intended to be solely base on IRC, although
    it is the primary IPC mechanism for linking nodes together.

    "ThreatNet::IRC" is a base module that provides most of the IRC-specific
    classes.

    At the present time, it contains only one class,
    ThreatNet::IRC::Envelope.

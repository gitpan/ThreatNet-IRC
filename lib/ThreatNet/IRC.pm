=head1 NAME

ThreatNet::IRC - ThreatNet IRC-specific classes

=head2 DESCRIPTION

The ThreatNet concept is not intended to be solely base on IRC, although it
is the primary IPC mechanism for linking nodes together.

C<ThreatNet::IRC> is a base module that provides most of the IRC-specific
classes.

At the present time, it contains only one class, L<ThreatNet::IRC::Envelope>.
